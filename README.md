## How do I cook Chocolate Cookies?
-   Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
    
-   Cream sugar and margarine in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs, one at a time, then stir in vanilla.
    
-   Combine flour, cocoa, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl. Add to the creamed mixture and mix until just blended. Stir in walnuts. Drop spoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto ungreased cookie sheets.
    
-   Bake in the preheated oven until edges are set and centers are soft, 8 to 10 minutes. Let sit briefly before transferring to wire racks to cool completely.
